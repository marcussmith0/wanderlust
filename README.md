#About Wanderlust
Wanderlust is a vacation-photo sharing app where users create a profile, upload photos to a timeline, add comments and create a photo map showing where each photo was taken. 
Users can then share photography timelines outside the web application. Users can also connect with other users and add 'likes' to others' photos. 
A portion of the application is powered by the Yelp API, allowing users to search nearby eateries or food services.
